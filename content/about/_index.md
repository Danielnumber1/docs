The Gibbon docs are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple plain-text format that can be authored with any text editor, a number of [online](https://dillinger.io/) [tools](http://www.ctrlshift.net/project/markdowneditor/), or directly in the GitHub editor. You can learn more about the Markdown syntax with a quick [online guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).


The documentation site is built with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deploys via [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
