## Open Source!

All of our docs are open source, written and contributed to by members of the Gibbon community.

Look for the __{{<icon fa-code-fork >}} Edit Page__ link in the top right corner of each page. If you spot a typo or would like to help expand the docs, feel free to [edit the page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) and submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). This automatically notifies us when you've made changes so we can review them and merge them into the docs. 

## Written in Markdown

The docs are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple plain-text format that can be authored with any text editor, a number of [online](https://dillinger.io/) [tools](http://www.ctrlshift.net/project/markdowneditor/), or directly in the GitHub editor. You can learn more about the Markdown syntax with a quick [online guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Built with Hugo

This documentation site is built with the awesome open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is based on [DocDock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock), a fork of the [Learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) theme, and has been customized for Gibbon.

## Deploys with Netlify

Each time a change is made to the [Gibbon Docs repository](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/docs/) on GitHub the whole site is automatically generated and deployed via the amazing JAM-stack wizardry of [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
