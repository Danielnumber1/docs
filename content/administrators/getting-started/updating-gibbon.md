## Core Updates

1.  The system will alert you of new updates to the core, when you visit System Admin.
    *   Note, that this does not apply to systems running [Cutting Edge Code](https://gibbonedu.org/cutting-edge-code/).
2.  Use the Update action in System Admin for semi-automatic updates to the core, as follows:
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">**Backup your database and installation files.**</span>
    2.  Download and unzip the latest version of Gibbon.
    3.  Login to your Gibbon installation and got to Admin > System Admin > Update.
    4.  Update your install base with the newly downloaded files, taking care not to overwrite any additional modules and themes you have installed.
    5.  Refresh the Update page, and it should show there are some database updates to be run. Run these by pressing the Submit button.
    6.  If the new version includes a lot of theme changes, you may need to refresh your page a few times to see things correctly.
    7.  In some cases you might need to log out and back in for all changes to be effective.
