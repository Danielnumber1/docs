### Introduction

**Lesson Planner** allows teachers to create, manage and deliver individual lesson, according to the classes you teach and the details of your timetable (if you have a timetable setup for you). In addition, you can manage lessons created automatically through the use of [Smart Units](/teachers/learn/planner/units/). You can choose whether to make lessons available to students and/or parents, and in doing so use Gibbon as a [virtual learning environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment). The image below shows lessons which have been created for a class, organised by date:

Below you can see the content from an individual lesson plan, including multimedia elements (an image, and a Google Doc):
