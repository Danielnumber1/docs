1.  Enter a subject and message body.
2.  Choose recipients in the Targets section (see below).

### Targets

When properly configured, Gibbon knows a lot about your school, making it possible to send messages out to numerous different targets. In the example below, a message is being sent to all students, staff and parents associated in Years 7-9 ICT. ![Messenger Targets](/wp/2015/08/Messenger-Targets-1024x944.png) It is always worth double checking your messages before sending, as you are potentially sending the same message our many times over.

### Read Receipts

As of v13 (due for release January 20th 2017), Gibbon supports read receipts for messenger emails. [Click here]({{< relref "read-receipts.md" >}}) to learn more.
