### Introduction

The Gibbon homepage for teachers seeks to give you all the information you need to do your job as an education, in one place, with quick access to other data from around the system built right in.

### Features

The image below highlights some of the main functions you can find on a fully configured homepage. [![Teacher Home Page](https://gibbonedu.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Teacher-Home-Page-843x1024.png)](https://gibbonedu.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Teacher-Home-Page.png) Students see a similar, but slightly reduced set of functionality, allowing them to interact with the lesson plans, homework and assessed work that you give them access to.
