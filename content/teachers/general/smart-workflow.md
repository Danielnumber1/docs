### Introduction

Gibbon was designed by teachers for teachers. In supporting you doing your job, Gibbon's Smart Workflow provides you with structures to:

1.  Map your curriculum
2.  Plan your curriculum
3.  Create lesson plans
4.  Assign and collect work
5.  Assess student progress

### Getting Started

As a teacher, when you first log in to Gibbon, the Getting Started help box will assist you in making the most of Smart Workflow. Each of the main five links will take you to the relevant part of the system, and give you advice on how to use it.
